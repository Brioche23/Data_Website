            <h2>The Internet of people</h2>
            <p class="textbox">In our fully digitalised corporate-led world, Data has become the biggest source of
                power.
                Personal data are
                used to train machines and algorithms about our habits, preferences, and patterns. They foster a
                market
                in
                which to have better (and most likely free) services we pay with our personal information.
                To understand the magnitude of this exchange of information we can see how the worldwide internet
                adoption
                has changed in the last 25 years.</p>

                <p class="textbox foreground sticky-top">In just three decades the number of people connected to the
                    internet went from from
                    basically zero to almost 5 billion. Phones, Tablets, and Personal Computers (and also Fridges) now
                    allow
                    us to exist (and potentially be exposed) in the digital realm.</p>

            <p class="textbox quote">Personal data is often compared to oil—it powers today’s most profitable
                corporations, just like fossil fuels energized those of the past. <br> - Wired</p>
            <p class="textbox">Despite being submerged in this data-exchanging network we rarely know what data we give
                away, and where that data ends up.</p>
