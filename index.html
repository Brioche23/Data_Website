            <p class="textbox">In our fully digitalised corporate-led world, Data has become the biggest source of
                power.
                Personal data are
                used to train machines and algorithms about our habits, preferences, and patterns. They foster a
                market
                in
                which to have better (and most likely free) services we pay with our personal information.

                internet

                    allow
                    us to exist (and potentially be exposed) in the digital realm.</p>
